<h3>Data security</h3>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>The security of data is a cornerstone of this project. Some of your personally identifying information is stored in the database in unencrypted format, your name and email address for example. We require that information to be stored in unencrypted text so that when we email you, we can include your first name and surname as proof that we are the ones emailing you rather than spammers.</p>
<p>Your Open Category ID number, Specific Category Certificate number, and your Operational Authorisation number however are Privileged information. Our having unencrypted access to them would pose a data security risk and as such they are encrypted in your browser and sent to us for storage as encrypted blobs. We do not, therefore, store this as data in the Privacy sense. There is no means for us to decrypt these fields.</p>
<h4>Authentication</h4>
<p>When you create an account, an AES256 key is created for your account in your browser. It is encrypted with your password and the encrypted key is stored. A hash of your password is created in your browser, using PBKDF2, and that hash is stored on the server. This password is not for authentication, it's used purely to provide a key for the encryption process.</p>
<p>Authentication is done via the generation of emails and unique keys, coupled with a 2FA app like Authy or Google Authenticator. While this may seem a little convoluted, the degree of security that an application like this requires as a third party solution is a step above anything I have ever undertaken and so requires the most stringent of security measures.</p>
