<p>The MOAP project is being conceived to make my life easier, for storing and backing up of the files and paperwork required for managing and maintaining my Operational Authorisation paperwork.</p>
<p>The project is completely unofficial, has no support (from me, from the IAA, or from AirNav), has not been generalised and is something I am using for my own purposes.</p>
<p>I recommend reading the page explaining data security, as authentication here may not make sense if you don't. You will need a Two Factor Authenticator, such as Google Authenticator; Authy; or the one provided by Last-Pass or 1Password, in order to log in.</p>
