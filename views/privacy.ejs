<h3>Privacy</h3>
<p>The security of data is a cornerstone of this project. In order to allow for user sessions to retain your logged-in status, a cookie is stored on your computer which contains a session identifier. That session identifier is passed to the server every time you click a link and checked against our database, which is where your data is stored.</p>
<p>Some of your personally identifying information is stored in the database in unencrypted format, your name and email address for example. We require that information to be stored in unencrypted text so that when we email you, we can include your first name and surname as proof that we are the ones emailing you rather than spammers.</p>
<p>Your Open Category ID number, Specific Category Certificate number, and your Operational Authorisation number however are Privileged information. Our having unencrypted access to them would pose a data security risk and as such they are encrypted in your browser and sent to us for storage as encrypted data.</p>
<p>When you create an account, an AES256 key is created for your account in your browser. It is encrypted with your password and the encrypted key is stored. When you log in, the encrypted key is downloaded to your browser and decrypted there. It is then used to decrypt and encrypt things as necessary.</p>
